# Since Docker users using "RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ..." in
# their Dockerfiles don't go delete the lists files afterwards, we want them to
# be as small as possible on-disk, so we explicitly request that Apt keep them
# compressed on-disk too instead of decompressing them.

# For comparison, an "apt-get update" layer without this on a pristine
# "debian:wheezy" base image was "29.88 MB", where with this it was only
# "8.273 MB".
